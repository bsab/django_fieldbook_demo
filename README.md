Django-Fieldbook-Demo is a lightweight app that show how Django interacts with the Fieldbook.com API.

It's a demo of [django-fieldbook](https://github.com/bsab/django-fieldbook.git) package.

Usage
-----

If you prefer to run it directly on your local machine, I suggest using
[virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/) (maybe have a look at
[virtualenvwrapper](https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)),
anyway here the commands you have to enter:

    pip install -r requirements.txt
